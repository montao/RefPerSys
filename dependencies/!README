This dependencies/ subdirectory of the RefPerSys (REFlexive PERsistent
SYStem) free software inference engine project (see
http://refpersys.org/ and code on
https://github.com/RefPerSys/RefPerSys/ ....) should contain small
self-sufficient dependencies (in C++ or C) useful to it.

A small dependency is an open source code of less than a dozen textual
files and less than ten thousand lines in total.

Before adding anything here, discuss the addition on
<team@refpersys.org> and <forum@refpersys.org> or by whatsapp. Be sure
to tell where do you found the source code and under what licence (it
should be GPLv3+ compatible).

When adding some files here, please use the following conventions

If possible, contact their original authors and mention RefPerSys to
them and get their explict permission to copy their source files (and
mention their name and perhaps email).

Make a single subdirectory, whose name is short and some C identifier.

Copy in that single subdirectory the header files and the
implementation files.

Add SPDX licence comments in the first few lines if they are not
there.

Add a file named !README giving name of original authors, URL of
original source code, and date (month, year) when you contacted the
original authors.

Edit the ChangeLog file if possible.

Edit RefPerSys build code (GNUmakefile or other). Test that the build
works and that redumping works.
